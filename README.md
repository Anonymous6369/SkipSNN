# SkipSNN Efficiently Classifying Spike Trains with Event-attention

Anonymous repository for SkipSNN: Efficiently Classifying Spike Trains with Event-attention.
This repository contains the implementation of SkipSNN.

### The problem of efficient classification of spike trains.
![SkipSNN_problem](./fig/skipsnn_problem.png)

The problem definition of efficient classification of spike trains. The spike trains are generated by an event camera, which is an imaging sensor that responds to local changes in brightness. Each pixel inside an event camera operates independently and asynchronously, reporting changes in brightness as they occur, and staying silent otherwise. Therefore, each image can be considered as binary event image.

## Instructions on training SkipSNN

The following script is for training:

```
python main_nmnist_noise.py
```
<b>Parameters:</b>

+ __run()__ :
	+ __N_CLASSES__ : number of classes for classification
